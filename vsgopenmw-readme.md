What is vsgopenmw?
==================

vsgopenmw is a rewrite (not a port) of OpenMW using Vulkan/VulkanSceneGraph (VSG) in place of OpenGL/OpenSceneGraph (OSG). vsgopenmw aims to be faster than OpenMW and follows the philosophy "minimal and complete" of the VSG. In the process, some non-OSG code has to be dropped or rewritten because OpenMW isn't minimal or complete. Unlike OpenMW, vsgopenmw limits its scope to TES3 and doesn't aim to become a general-purpose game engine. For architectural, legal and performance reasons, and to respect the expressed wishes of Bethesda Softworks, existing attempts at TES4 support will be moved to another project supporting only TES4.
