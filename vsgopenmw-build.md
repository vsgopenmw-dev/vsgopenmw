Which platforms does vsgopenmw support?
=======================================

vsgopenmw doesn't support platforms. By definition of a platform, it's the other way around: platforms support applications.

Which platforms support vsgopenmw?
==================================

vsgopenmw should appear in your Linux or FreeBSD package repository of choice soon. In the meantime, you can build vsgopenmw the usual cmake way on any platform that comes with a standards-compliant C++20 environment and Vulkan support. In addition to OpenMW's dependencies, you'll need VulkanSceneGraph-<TBR> and vsgXchange-1.0.2 installed the usual cmake way. OpenSceneGraph headers (not libraries) are still required for the time being.

Which operating systems don't support vsgopenmw?
========================================

Windows doesn't support vsgopenmw because Windows is not a platform and is not standards compliant.

Mac OS X and iOS don't support vsgopenmw because they're not platforms and because Apple doesn't support Vulkan.

Android doesn't support vsgopenmw because Android is not a platform.

How do I use vsgopenmw on an unsupporting operating system?
===================================================

You can simply install a minimal version of Linux, also known as Linux-on-<OS> on top of your OS. You can get native performance with this method because Vulkan drivers load in userspace. To ease the process, vsgopenmw includes the VSGOPENMW_INDIRECT fall back to indirect rendering (not to be confused with software rendering) in case a direct Vulkan surface is not available.

On Android, we can build and run vsgopenmw using Termux with no need for a PC or rooted device. Termux doesn't officially support hardware acceleration, but it provides a Vulkan loader library and that's all we need.

We can either use Termux' vulkan-loader-android to access the Android system's Vulkan driver or we can install a full proot-distro Linux system and use a self built driver with it (e.g. Freedreno-KGSL). For graphical output we can use XServer-XSDL, VNC or Termux-X11 in VSGOPENMW_INDIRECT mode. Direct rendering is yet to be explored.
