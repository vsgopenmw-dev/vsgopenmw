vsgopenmw is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are encouraged to make a donation to environmental causes.

You are encouraged to use renewable electricity to run, build and develop vsgopenmw.

Linking vsgopenmw into unethical ("closed-source", "proprietary") software, made by profit-oriented, exploitative corporations is discouraged.  Note that the terms of the GPL3, the license that OpenMW is based on, explicitly forbid linking into proprietary software under certain circumstances.  If your envisioned use of vsgopenmw has any relation to a closed-source software or platform, please consult a lawyer first.

You can also sponsor the development of vsgopenmw.  vsgopenmw sponsors can vote for features.  The money goes to charity anyway.
